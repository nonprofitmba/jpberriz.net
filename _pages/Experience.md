I worked for nearly three years as a consultant for the World Bank. I was part of a team that prepared, followed the implementation and evaluated Legal and Judicial Reform Projects in Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela. My time at the WB was an extraordinary professional learning experience. It taught me how international organizations come about doing their job in the areas I am interested, as Access to Justice. And I also acquired an efficient working method, which I still apply today as a consultant. By the way, the map you see as featured picture of this post is called a Peter’s Projection Map and it’s an ‘area accurate map’. You can learn more about it here

I was lucky enough to found a consulting firm and a <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/todo-legal">nonprofit</a>. It has been an extraordinarily fun ride. Being an entrepreneur (business and social) has been a fulfilling experience. It hits me in the right spot. The learning never stops, the dreaming fuels the excitement of every day work. I’m continuously working and learning. It’s just awesome. 
<p>The consulting firm is <a href="http://estrategiaslid.com">Estrategias LiD</a> – LiD stands for Law, Innovation and Development. It’s based in Venezuela and offers to local businesses (all types and sizes) tools to improve their knowledge management skills and practices in the context of a new tax law that requires them to. It uses web resources extensively for client communication, training and coaching. 
<p>We created the first blog that helps businesses carry out this law.  It covers legal issues as well as the basics of technology and innovation management for free <a href="http://loctiblog.com">[loctibog]</a>. 
<p>We also created the first (and only - up to now) elearning on the same subjects to expand on what we share through the blog - <a href="http://aulalocti.com">[aulalocti]</a> 
<p>We are currently developing a web-based “technology and innovation marketplace” – something like eBay (but much smaller) for providers of services and goods related to technology and innovation management, and businesses that are carrying out projects on technology and innovation management. 
[box type="shadow"]<p>Experience and many studies have made it clear that innovation and new technological knowledge in the private sector boosts the country’s economic development. We believe that we are contributing to the economic development of the country by helping businesses increase their technology and innovation management capabilities.[/box]

Through my <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/lid/">Consulting Firm</a> I was able to finance an Access to Justice Project that I had been shaping and planing since I was in <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/grassroots-lawyering">Guasdualito</a>. It begun as a Innovation Project of LiD Strategies, and it is now developing into a Foundation in its own right. We are developing a replicable and sustainable model of a decentralized pro-poor sustainable law firm. 

<p>It is an innovative approach to increasing access to justice and legal inclusion of the poor of developing countries. The pilot of the model is working in Venezuela and is called "Todo Legal". Todo Legal challenges most common assumptions about the legal needs of the poor and lawyering for them in Latin America: that the poor don't have legal issues, and that the poor don't have enough money to pay for a lawyer. None of these are true. Todo Legal has researched what the legal problems of the poor are, and has developed ways of lowering the costs of legal services to make them affordable for many people who never had access to a lawyer before. 

<p>Access to legality itself as well as access to the Courts for dispute resolution has to be done - in the vast majority of cases - through a Lawyer. Legal institutions like Notaries and Registries require a Lawyer to oversee all transactions. Other public social institutions like Schools and Hospitals require that individuals have certain degree of legality in order to provide service. Free legal services in Venezuela are not efficient, numerous enough or distributed geographically so that most of the population of the country - which is poor - can access them. Private Lawyers normally don't think of making a living by servicing the poor, because Law School itself is a tool for upward social mobility and after obtaining a law degree people expect to use it to obtain the highest income possible in a very harsh economy. In consequence, the poor don't have access to Lawyers, and therefore to Courts, Registries, Notaries and can even be easily excluded from basic social services like Hospitals and Schools. I call this the phenomenon of legal exclusion. 

[box type="shadow"]Todo Legal is intended to fight legal exclusion by providing legal services close to the residential areas of the poor. We are in the process of testing our model to determine if it is cost-efficient and financially sustainable. [/box] 

<p>Todo Legal is a practical application of theories from C.K. Prahalad (Base of the Pyramid), Hernando de Soto (Mistery of Capital), and Amartya Sen (Development as Freedom) and my own experiences at the <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/world-bank/">World Bank</a>, as a <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/grassroots-lawyering/">grassroots lawyer</a>, and as a Volunteer in <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/prisons">prisons</a> and with <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/refugees/">Refugees</a>.

The first thing I fell in love with at law school (the only thing really) was a student group that volunteered in prisons – VTEP. Volunteer work allowed me to learn how the law really worked. 
<p>Our main activity was giving prisoners legal aid. The courts’ delay on the vast majority of cases and the lack of information available to the detainee about his or her legal status was – and still is – an wide-spread problem.  We had a variety of other activities that allowed us to offer a small window of peace to prisoners who lived in a never-ending cycle of violence – something for which latin american jails are famous for. We taught tai-chi, meditation, reading and writing, we had reading groups and we sold hand made crafts at our university and brought back their profits. 
<p>I was a member of VTEP for five years (in Venezuela, law is a five-year long undergraduate program) and led it for two academic years. It defined my law school experience and the type of lawyering I would practice in the future. 
<p>I also had the chance to be a volunteer in a refugee settlement during law school. Check it out

At the undergraduate level, I taught the following courses at the <a href="http://www.unimet.edu.ve">Metropolitan University</a>, in Caracas, Venezuela: 
<ul>
<li>Law and Society in Latin America</li> 
<li>Sociology of Law</li> 
<li>Ethics in Law and Business</li> 
</ul>

<p>At a postgraduate level, I was a lecturer of the course on Judicial Reform in Latin America, for the <a href="http://www.ucab.edu.ve/programas-de-estudios-avanzados-derechos-humanos.html">International Human Rights Diploma,</a>, mention in Access to Justice, organized by the Jesuit University Organization and the Inter-American Human Rights Institute. 

<p>I also published a paper on <a href="http://biblioteca.tsj.gov.ve/cgi-win/be_alex.exe?Acceso=T018800022683/4&Nombrebd=btsj">Judicial Reform in Latin America</a>  in the following book: <a href="http://biblioteca.tsj.gov.ve/cgi-win/be_alex.exe?Acceso=T018800022683/0&Nombrebd=btsj" target="_blank">Acceso a la Justicia</a>, ISBN: 980-244-472-3, Agencia Canadiense de Desarrollo Internacional – Fundación Konrad Adenauer Stiftung – UCAB, 2006; ISBN: 980-244-472-3.]

My first job after graduating from Law School was quite different from what my peers were embarking on and far off the beaten path. I moved to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&source=embed&msa=0&msid=113384698899901515978.00048ad48761ed96737d1&ll=7.188101,-70.664062&spn=44.867629,78.662109&z=4" target="_blank">Guasdualito</a>, a small, rural, very poor, and militarized town at the southern border with Colombia where most of the civilian population was suspect of being or collaborating with the Colombian Guerrilla. I went to Guasdualito as one of the first participants in a new Professional Volunteer Program launched by the Jesuits and the <a href="http://www.ucab.edu.ve/" target="_blank">Universidad Católica Andrés Bello</a>, where I had just finished my Law Degree and was very involved in <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/experience/prisons/">volunteering as a law student</a>. 

<p>The Program consisted in sending recently graduated professionals to places where their newly acquired skills were needed the most, but where they normally wouldn't think of going to work - because it wouldn't fit the paradigm of 'normal' professional development. I spent two years living and working in Guasdualito. I was a Human Rights Lawyer that collaborated with the only Human Rights NGO there (CODEHUM), the Catholic Archdioceses, and UNHCR - the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I also implemented a Legal Education Project with the help of a Radio Station (Radio Fé y Alegría) and the Jesuits. <br/> 

<h4>Human Rights Lawyering</h4>
<p>The border with Colombia was just a few kilometers away from Guasdualito. The area was militarized on both sides of the border. On the Venezuela side, Guasdualito and its surroundings were considered a 'red zone' because even though it wasn't an active war zone (like it was on the Colombian side), the Colombian Guerrilla was very present. They would take advantage of the difficulties that long distances between populations and thick terrain imposed on the Venezuelan Military in its attempt to protect the the entire length of the border. 

<p>The Guerrilla operated in two ways: they would set temporary camps in those difficult to reach 'rest areas', and they pretended to be civilians and camouflaged with local population, recruiting members among the poorest and extorting ranch owners by charging them a fee to not be kidnapped. This second Guerrilla tactic led to numerous Human Rights violations. It was difficult for the Military to tell apart who was a collaborator of the Guerrilla and who was not. 

<p>In one occasion I assisted CODEHUM in a case of a teenager that was arrested and charged with "Rebellion" in Military Court because he was - allegedly - on a bus that was set to cross the border from Venezuela to Colombia with a box filled with camouflage uniforms for the Guerrilla. The Civilian Prosecutor would not help us reclaim the child's right to be judged in a civilian court because the Military Justice simply was hermetic. When we approached the Military Public Defender as a Human Rights NGO, he didn't show any interest in our participation to guarantee a fair trail for the teenager. To get us off their back, they transferred the teenager to another Military Jail and his case to another Military Court, in a location where the NGO didn't have any people to follow-up the case. At the end of the day, the military objectives of protecting the border prevailed. 

<p>That same Civilian Prosecutor received several life threats because of another case were he was prosecuting someone for a common crime who was - allegedly - connected with the Guerrilla. He was a nervous wreck. He had to carry a gun - which he had never done before. Since the Guerrilla had people in the population who would carry out tasks for them, like giving messages or assassinating someone, he suspected everybody. Anyone could walk up to him on the street and shoot him. These types of targeted killings were not uncommon in Guasdualito. He requested a transfer of post, but it was denied, so he quit the job and left town anyway. 

<p>Civilian Police were also a source of Human Rights violations. Maybe because of a desire to collaborate with the Military or lack of proper training, there were several cases of torture. Frequently, this happened with prisoners who were thought to be connected to the Guerrilla. 

<p>To make matters more complicated, the Colombian Guerrilla would take advantage of the low socio-economic levels and wide-spread poverty to gain adepts and ensure its settlement within population. They offered - and were very effective in delivering - institutional services to poor populations where the Venezuelan public institutions were (and still are) absent : conflict resolutions (justice), policing, loans, and social assistance (food and clothes), etc. <br /> 

<h4>Legal Education Project</h4> 
I also developed and executed a Legal Education Project. The Project consisted in offering free legal advise twice a week at an office the Jesuits had near the center of town, and also producing and hosting a weekly radio show to talk in a simple manner about key laws and their application to typical situations local life. The general objective was to increase the population's knowledge of their rights and the law, hopefully to reduce the Civil and Human Rights violations. 

<p>The radio show was done at the Jesuit-run radio station <a href="http://www.feyalegria.org/" target="_blank">"Instituto Radiofónico Fe y Alegría"</a>, which is a compliment of their education work in Venezuela and Latin America, creating schools and universities. 

<p>Adapting to Guasdualito's life and trying to become part of the community was not easy. I had a pony tail and a city accent. While my family was not rich, I was giving good private education and my mother (who raised me by herself) was always able to cover our needs. This was the first time I was immersed in a poor community for a long and continuous period of time, and had as an objective to become a member of it while I was there. It was an extraordinary learning experience. I was very lucky to share my days with the Jesuits that lived there. Besides the personal challenge, the professional challenge was great. I was not trained for any of this. All I was taught were the legal texts, not how to use them to help a community, to fight for social justice, or to promote economic and social development. So I made the most out of my trips to Caracas - every other month for a weekend to visit my mother, on a 14 hour bus ride -, to search libraries and bookstores for these practical questions I had about lawyering for the poor. The first area where I found some vocabulary I could apply was in Legal Sociology or Sociology of the Law. Human Rights were also useful but more as legal rules and standards rather than as a source of knowledge on "how to become a community lawyer". Where I found some clearer answers that I felt described the problems regarding the application of the legal and justice system I saw every day and offered concepts, notions and approaches to these problems, was what is referred to as "Access to Justice". 

[box type="shadow"]Guasdualito taught me that there was a bigger picture to the problems of the implementation of the Law. And that those who studied "Access to Justice" were also interested in these implementation issues. So from there on "Access to Justice" was my main interests, learning field and approach to lawyering. [/box] 

After these two years in Guasdualito I left to Europe and the Unites States for my <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/education/">Graduates Studies</a>. Two Master's in Law and one International Diploma, during which all my thinking and arguing referenced to what I had experienced and learned in Guasdualito, with Refugees, and in Caracas's <em>barrios</em> and prisons. When I returned to Venezuela I worked as a specialist in <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/my-story/justice-and-legal-reform/">Judicial and Legal Reform, first for the Supreme Court of Venezuela and then as a consultant on Word Bank</a>.

<p>During my third year of Law School I participated in a Volunteer Program sponsored by the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home" target="_blank">United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)</a> called "Camp Sadako". The purpose of Camp Sadako was to raise awareness about the situation of the millions of refugees of the World by sending college and graduate students to live in a Refugee settlement and then share the experience back at their home universities. So, for seven weeks I lived in a Guatemalan Refugee Settlement called <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/wp-content/uploads/Mapa-Capeche.png"><em>Santo Domingo de Kesté </em> </a> located in Campeche, Mexico. 

<p>Out of curiosity, on my way to the settlement, I picked up a copy of the Mexican Constitution and the State's (Campeche) Civil and Criminal Codes. After a couple of weeks in the settlement I stumbled upon an incredibly interesting situation right down a legal anthropologist's alley: a committee of elderly authorities was keeping a man in jail - they had built a small jail room in the Settlement - for casting a spell on a another man, and making him ill until causing him to die. The elders were told that the UNHCR Volunteer - me - who was living in the Settlement was a student of the law, so they wanted to talk to me about how the situation they had in hand with the criminal sorcerer would cross over to Mexican authorities. They considered the sorcerer dangerous and wanted him off the Settlement. 

<p>I did my studying and I didn't have any good news for the committee of elders. Being a sorcerer and casting a spell was not considered a crime under Mexican law. If they wanted to respect Mexican law, they had to let the sorcerer out of jail. The most they could do was to ask him to leave the Settlement. The complicated part was that <em>they</em> had committed a crime by putting this man in jail without the legal authority to do so (they had none under Mexican law). I left it to UNCHR to explain that one to them. 

<p>Since it was clear that the Settlements' authorities and leaders had many questions about how the Settlement fitted in Mexican law, I prepared a simple guide with what I thought were the relevant basic legal concepts and rules they needed to know, and offered a workshop for them to go over it. It worked out great. 

<p>Those seven weeks were amazing to me. I had the chance to be sensitive to my surroundings, identify a social need, be creative, and plan and execute a small project to address that social need. 

[box type="shadow"] Again, similarly to my experience as a <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/prisons/">volunteer in prisons</a> I found myself working to bring closer the law to poor/excluded people/groups. I had the initiative and creativity necessary, and I effectively executed an action with positive results. It felt good. It made sense inside. Another step in the right direction. [/box] 

By the end of my Law School years I was a social action fanatic. I had worked as a volunteer to help Venezuelan indigenous groups, street children, and poor schools in Caracas' slums. I graduated with a very long ponytail - the only one among around two hundred students - and was about to take up <a href="http://juanpablomolina.com/grassroots-lawyering/">my first job as a lawyer in a guerrilla-packed rural area at the south border with Colombia.</a>
