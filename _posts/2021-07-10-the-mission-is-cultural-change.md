I learned many lessons while witnessing how Hugo Chavez brought radical change to Venezuelan society. He changed the country where I was born from a mediocre democracy to a strong authoritarian regime that forced me to leave with my family.

#### Change the culture to change the world

One of these lessons is that the nature of big radical social change is cultural. To change the world - for the better or for the worse - is about changing how a large group of people make automatic choices. 

Seth Godin says it much better than me on this [blog post](https://seths.blog/2013/07/change-the-culture-change-the-world/){:target="_blank"}

#### Day by day, inch by inch

Cultural change is not implemented quickly. It takes a lot of time to modify the behavior of a large group of people. To win that war of cultural change, you have to fight many battles. Some you will win and some you will loose - because the dominant culture pushes back. Be patient, persistent, consistent, resilient. 



...

I often forget that my work is about cultural change. 

I want nonprofits to evolve from being perceived and operated as charities, to competitive organizations. Because the mission of the social sector is too important: trying the make the world a better place. 

I also want to change the culture around justice. I want law and justice practitioners to approach their work as system designers. I believe that this will create fairer outcomes. 

I also forget often how powerful a dominant culture can be. So often I am surprised and frustrated to find resistance where I expected support.
