## Hello my friend,
<br>
Here are a couple of things I thought were worth sharing with you this week: 

1. **The Nonprofit Manifesto.** I revisited the [Nonprofit Manifesto](/nonprofit-manifesto/), polished it a bit, and sent it out to the world of LinkedIn asking what people think. Help me out and tell me what you would add or edit. 
   
2. **Awesome book of nonprofit cases.** I found this awesome book [Cases in Nonprofit Management](/cases-in-nonprofit-management/) and have been using it to prepare my upcoming class on Introduction to Nonprofit Management.
    
3. **Nonprofit Marketing** I had a [fight in my mind about nonprofit marketing](/the-wrong-way-to-think-of-nonprofit-marketing) with Gary Grobman, the author of the textbook I'm supposed to use for my class. I think I won the fight when I threw at him Seth Godin's book This is Marketing.
  
4. **Website comment form.** I tried Wordpress for the nonprofit.mba website. Hated it. Ended up using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PN9dGXOSE9qIsp1Mp0SXPpciviaNL6lJ5EmYG3v9BuoESPlQ5Vu2HNKGr1iesskfxP6uD) as a [static website](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/what-is-a-static-website/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PN9dGXOSE9qIsp1Mp0SXPpciviaNL6lJ5EmYG3v9BuoESPlQ5Vu2HNKGr1iesskfxP6uD) generator, hosting the files on [Github](https://github.com/nonprofitmba/nonprofit.mba?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PN9dGXOSE9qIsp1Mp0SXPpciviaNL6lJ5EmYG3v9BuoESPlQ5Vu2HNKGr1iesskfxP6uD), serving them to the internet through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PN9dGXOSE9qIsp1Mp0SXPpciviaNL6lJ5EmYG3v9BuoESPlQ5Vu2HNKGr1iesskfxP6uD), and making my own modifications to the [Poole/Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PN9dGXOSE9qIsp1Mp0SXPpciviaNL6lJ5EmYG3v9BuoESPlQ5Vu2HNKGr1iesskfxP6uD) theme. Yes, I'm a geek.
