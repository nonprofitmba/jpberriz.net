I'm preparing for a new class I'm going to teach on Introduction to Nonprofits. I was getting acquainted with the text book and found these ideas about nonprofit marketing: 

> Marketing shares much in common with fundraising. One aspect that differentiates the two is that fundraising implies a relationship whereby a donor makes a gratuitous contribution to the organization without an expectation of anything substantially tangible received in return, and does not benefit directly from the donation any more than someone who does not make a donation. 
>
> Marketing, on the other hand, implies a transition in which the organization seeks to convince an individual or organization to make a voluntary exchange of money for goods and services provided by the organization, and the organization can use these funds without any strings attached. 
>
> -- Gary M. Grobman - An Introduction to the Nonprofit Sector.

I think this approach to nonprofit marketing falls short:

1. Marketing (for nonprofits and commercial businesses) is about letting the right people know that you have something of value for them.

2. Nonprofits are value-creating organizations. Nonprofits engage in a value creating process just like commercial businesses. But our purpose for creating value, and the type of value we create, vary significantly. 

3. Nonprofits create significant value for donors. And we engage in transactions with them. We receive their money and use it for our mission. They expect a receipt for their donation that allows them to deduct it from their taxes. They also want intangible value from our nonprofit: feelings, information, identity, status, purpose, belonging, a sense of service. Nonprofits must package and deliver these intangibles. 

   

To further  make my point on the value of intangibles, I want to share with you a quote from Set Godin's book "This is Marketing":

> Harvard marketing professor Theodore Levitt famously said, “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit. They want a quarter-inch hole.”  
>
> The lesson is that the drill bit is merely a feature, a means to an end, but what people truly want is the hole it makes.
>
> But that doesn’t go nearly far enough. No one wants a hole.
>
> What people want is the shelf that will go on the wall once they drill the hole.
>
> Actually, what they want is how they’ll feel once they see how uncluttered everything is, when they put their stuff on the shelf that went on the wall, now that there’s a quarter-inch hole.
>
> But wait . . .
>
> They also want the satisfaction of knowing they did it themselves.
>
> Or perhaps the increase in status they’ll get when their spouse admires the work.
>
> Or the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the bedroom isn’t a mess, and that it feels safe and clean.
>
> “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit. They want to feel safe and respected.”
>
> Bingo.



If you haven't read This is Marketing, please do. It is essential for nonprofit work.
