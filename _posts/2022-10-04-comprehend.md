> “The evil that is in the world comes out of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence, if they lack understanding. ” ― Albert Camus, La Peste (The Plague)

Do you have a thorough understanding of the lives of the people you want to create value for?

Creating value that improves the lives of others is the ***purpose*** of a nonprofit. But to make people's lives better, you first need to ***comprehend*** them. You need to understand their lives and their circumstances, thoroughly and truthfully.

This story is a good example to illustrate this idea. An international NGO visited a small village in Africa. While there, they observed small groups of women walk away from the village in the mornings. They walked for over an hour to collect water from the nearest river. It seemed like a tough trek. They walked under the hot sun, through the bush. They carried their babies in slings, brought along small children, and also carried water pitchers.  To help, the NGO dug and built a well close to the village. Now the women didn’t have to go so far away to get water for their families. The NGO left the village happy with its work. A year later, the NGO returned to visit the village. They were hopeful to see how the well had improved the lives of the village's women. But instead, they found that the women didn’t use the well at all. They had kept going on their walks to the river to get the water. Baffled and intrigued, the NGO's asked an elder woman. Why wasn’t the well being used? They learned that the walk to the river wasn't only to collect water. It was for the women to be together, be away from the men, socialize, bathe in the river, and bathe their children. If they used the well, they would loose much more than what they gained. This is a good example of what happens when an organization takes action with good intentions and poor ***comprehension*** of the people they want to serve.

To ***comprehend*** the people you want to serve, follow these steps:

1. Start by creating a ***connection*** with them. Use ***empathy*** to try to see the world from their experience. Try to feel what they feel about their issues. Learn how they express their feelings and views. This is the first step in ***Human Centered Design.*** A powerful and useful tool.
2. Conduct ***research*** to learn what other experts think. Collect, read and analyze journals, articles, and papers. Become familiar with the ideas of others who are thinking and working to solve the same problems. Understand their perspective. Try to talk to them and develop relationships. If you have a different opinion than the experts and research supports, that’s ok. But make sure to have strong evidence that supports your point of view.
3. Gather your own evidence. Get data from the people you are serving. Use interviews, surveys, observation, etc.
4. Form an ***evidence-based*** opinion of your own. Contrast what you've learned through ***empathy***, ***research***, and your own evidence. Reach your own conclusions.
5. Evolve and question your own thinking. As your work progresses, continue to learn. Gather and analyze more research, add new sources, and challenge your assumptions. Enrich and adjust your understanding. Always keep in mind that if you are wrong, you could be causing harm. It's important that you are open to discovering your blind spots.

Having a clear in-depth understanding of the people you serve is a powerful asset. It will enhance your work in many other organizational functions. It will be invaluable when developing your ***theory of change,*** and your ***business model.*** It will also be useful for your ***strategic planning.*** You will also use it to define how to ***measure*** your progress towards your goals and your impact. It will also help you develop the stories that you will share with your ***donors*** and include in your ***grant*** applications. And it will guide you and your team while ***managing your program.***

It's always a good idea to increase your ***comprehension*** of the people you serve. But it is particularly important when you are starting your nonprofit. When the value you create for people is not making their lives better. And when the value you create for people is being questioned either internally or externally.

Of course, you can build your nonprofit on your personal experience and perspective. For example, you may have lived experience that you feel strongly about. But the risk is high if you don't carry out research, gather data, and question your assumptions. Your ***comprehension*** is a foundational function of your nonprofit. If it is not thorough and true, all your other nonprofit's ***functions*** are in danger. Your nonprofit may not achieve its mission. Don’t shy away from this work. The time and energy you invest in this will pay off.
