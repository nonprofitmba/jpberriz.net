At a basic level, an employee can be a good performer when they are explained what steps to follow to do their job, they follow them efficiently and on time, resulting in the desired outcomes. 

But we can do much more than tell an employee what they need to do. And they can do so much more for the organization.

We can show them why their activity is important within the context of our long term goals and within the context of all the moving parts of our organization.

This will unlock their capacity to bring more of themselves to the table. Their initiative, vision, creativity, resilience. Make suggestions, corrections, take initiative, perform beyond expectations. This will result in organizational growth, discovering unforeseen opportunities, and higher team member engagement and satisfaction with their work.
