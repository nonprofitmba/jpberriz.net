Thoughts about meeting with Amanda. She was worried that conversation with volunteer Heather asking her to leave could cause reputation issues because  Heather is connected in the community and is likely to bad-mouth us.

Stoic philosophers reminded me what we have under our control and what we don't.  In [The Enchiridion](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html), [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus) explains that:

> 1. Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.

Epictetus lists *reputation* explicitly as something outside our control.

In his awesome book [The Personal MBA](https://personalmba.com/), [Josh Kaufman](https://joshkaufman.net/) explains the following about reputation: 

Our content will help you master *principles* rather than tools or techniques. Mastering a tool or techniques allows you to implement it successfully to obtain a particular output. Mastering the principles on which a tool or technique is built allows you to evaluate the tool's effectiveness, understand how it works or is supposed to work, improve it or choose a better one. Understanding principles will help you think with more clarity and make better decisions. Mastering principles will make you a better manager and leader for your nonprofit, and more successful at your career.
