I've been reading the cases in ["Cases in Nonprofit Management"](/cases-in-nonprofit-management) all day today. 

I've been using them to test my Nonprofit Management Framework, to see if the Framework would actually work to solve the nonprofit management problems described in these cases. For each case, I asked myself, would the decision-maker have made a better decision if they had used the Framework? So far, the answer is yes in every case I've read. Then I wrote down my case analysis using the Framework.

To be honest, it was a relief... ! Until now, I've used the framework myself at work as nonprofit CEO, shared it with other CEOs and discussed how it applies to their work issues and it has seemed to be useful to them as well. But the casebook is a different test because even though these are made-up situations, they are very realistic, and each case occurs in a different type of organization and refers to different type of management issues.  So, to see how the Framework could be useful in such a wide-range of scenarios is encouraging. 

I think the Framework can help nonprofit managers and leaders assess the nature of a situation they are dealing with, identify the key principles in play, and ask the right questions that will uncover the right solutions. 

The Framework won't tell you what to do, but it will help you think clearly about what needs to be done... and I think that is golden. I mean, that's why I developed it, and that's how I used it, to think clearly and make good decision as a nonprofit Executive Director and CEO.  

If you want to check it out, you can download a summary of the Nonprofit Management Framework [here](/public/SummaryPyramid.pdf).
