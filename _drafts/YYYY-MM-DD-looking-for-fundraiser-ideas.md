If you're searching for fundraising ideas that will produce money for your nonprofit easily and quickly, please pause. 

just asking for other people's events. See which when you can do, they're not going to work. You're going to end up frustrated and back in square. One. These are things that work for them.

They will offer tons of ideas that have worked for them. And maybe some that they've seen others do, or some fundraiser ideas that actually haven't worked for them, but they don't mind sharing them in case you want to try them. 

Experimenting is fine. You can take one idea from the list, whichever you like the most and see if it works. But if it doesn't, it's time, energy, and money waisted. 

Would it be best if you had a way to quickly identify which of the ideas would probably work for you?



00:30

You need to figure out things that work for you. So, please pause and let me explain you just three basic concepts? This method takes a little bit more time, but it's not difficult And establish a foundation for you to have this first event and many more events that will be successful.

00:00
This is the advice. I would give the person who on the Facebook group nonprofit resources, asked for an event, that would give them. I think she said 2,000 or 3,000 dollars a month or a year, but some sort of study income.
00:24
If you're thinking of, if you are an unprofit and you're thinking of a event that's going to give you steady money and you ask that, hey, give me something that tell me about an event that it works for you or that you've seen work. That's gonna work for me.
00:46
That is like when you go online or you get through social media, pitches of, hey, try this side gig. It's great and it'll bring you money in, no matter, you know. And maybe good for other folks and they work for other folks. But that doesn't mean it's going to work for you.
01:09
I would recommend you start by understanding what an event is for, in the context of an unprofit. So for an unprofit, a fundraising event is an opportunity that you create for your supporters to give to you to your mission to your nonprofit.
01:41
So to decide well. What opportunity do I create? You have to start by asking yourself. Well, what do my supporters want to participate in? What would they want to give money to or volunteer, for or see in the news that I'm doing? And that has to, then to answer that question, you have to start with the question of who are my supporters and that has a couple of events.
02:17
The first one is demographically, right? Or they on the older side of the younger, what is their age group? What tends to be their education level? So, economical level, who are my my daughters, and you can look at your current donors and volunteers to answer that question, as even if you have a few, you know, only we'll start there.
02:40
You got to start somewhere and you can also make an educated guess. I think the people who supporters tend to be like this decisions, whatever makes sense to you. And using the data you already have the second question about, who are your supporters is their culture? Which means, why do they give to you?
02:58
Why do they engage with you? Why do they care about your mission and purpose? But what are their feelings and thoughts about what you're nonprofit? Does the problem you saw of or the opportunity, you create for others. And why do they feel about it? And you get that data and knowledge from talking to them, right?
03:20
And again, you can fold out do a survey, send it to your big list. If you have it of donors and volunteers and program partners, or you can have several conversations once you've narrowed down, who is you know the the most centric or couple of profiles of your supporters, you can talk to three or four or one of them, right?
03:48
If that's the if you have few donors and you just starting out as an improfit and go with that data. And again, if you're just starting, then you can. If you're starting on a profit you, you can assume that you would be a donor in a supporter and say, like, well, why do I care about this?
04:08
And that's an educated. Guess it's, it's very little data but it's as good as a kids point, when you starting. So once you know who your supporters are and why they give to you, I call the first part who you support us, are your audience and the second part why they give to you their time or their money is their culture because it's their values and they're feelings and thoughts about you.
04:37
So it's part of their culture. The third then is to ask yourself what would work for then. So for example, a 5k is a popular thing for a lot of profits to do, but that doesn't work for every audience, right? What if you haven't older audience, what if you have and they and they're not and you know, they're not going to walk a 5k.
05:02
I mean, maybe a lot of folk older folks are or in good shape and our exercising left to do it but some are not or you know it what what if you want to do a gala and like you're the profile of your of your volunteers and supporters are really not that type of people to spend money to go out to dinner at night and, you know, or a selling option.
05:23
Maybe they want to another part of me, the one fun mud run or maybe, I don't know. You know. So I think that at that that is also something you ask them, right? And also, when once you have a profile who they are, it all ideas will be much narrow.
05:48
You won't be looking for event ideas that, and that, that like any event idea would work, it'll be easier for your narrow down world of the 10 ideas that we had. Now that we know the, our audience is, you know, profile and culture. We, you know, it's really up to these two or three that would work for them and you can go to them with those who are three or maybe operation wise, you know, you those two are three, only one of them is something you actually can pull off in, you know, the time that you have to do it and resources in terms of people and energy and money, you have to do it.
06:29
Maybe some of them are more expensive that you wanted to require more effort than you're put. So that's a way to narrow it down to the side. What type of fundraising event would be good for your to carry out, and it's a better way of getting to it. A little bit longer takes more effort but it's going to be more successful if you go through it like this.
06:55
Instead of asking the open question of hey what works for you, I'm gonna copy it.
