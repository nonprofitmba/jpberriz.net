Thoughts about meeting with Amanda. She was worried that conversation with volunteer Heather asking her to leave could cause reputation issues because  Heather is connected in the community and is likely to bad-mouth us.

Stoic philosophers reminded me what we have under our control and what we don't.  In [The Enchiridion](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html), [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus) explains that:

> 1. Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.

Epictetus lists *reputation* explicitly as something outside our control.

In his awesome book [The Personal MBA](https://personalmba.com/), [Josh Kaufman](https://joshkaufman.net/) defines reputation as "what people think about a company or offer".  Which

Building a strong reputation is very valuable; people are willing to pay more for a good reputation.

It’s critical to understand that you don’t control your reputation, people will decide what your reputation is. You can’t “manage” it. You can only improve it over time by making sure that those who do business with you are glad they did.
