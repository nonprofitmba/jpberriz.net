## Case 1.1 Social Enterprise within a Nonprofit Organization. 

Bruno Conti liked to joke that he established Independence Matters in 1996 by accident. It was a joke because Independence Matters was born out of a work accident that left Bruno paralyzed from the waist down with no clear path about how to lead life as a disabled person. He liked to say that once he got “back on his feet” he dedicated himself to helping others who found themselves newly disabled with a roadmap for transitioning into and fully living life. The mission of the organization was “to provide support, identify solutions, and offer opportunities that enable persons with physical disabilities to participate fully in life.” 

Independence Matters programs included an array of social, health, recreational, and educational services. Among them, counseling and coaching of newly disabled individuals provided by a team of specially trained volunteer disabled mentors; transportation services; physician-led health services that provided information and referrals on a gamut of far-ranging health-related issues; professionally facilitated support groups for disabled individuals, their partners, and families; a fund for extraordinary medical expenses and other unanticipated expenses resulting from the disability; a wheelchair basketball team and swim program; and adaptive job training that was accompanied by a successful job referral and placement component. The nearly $7 million agency was well known throughout the community and highly respected for its work. 

Bruno was proud of what he had built and of the hundreds of lives he had touched through the work of Independence Matters, but he was tired of the constant fund-raising. Relative to the programs it offered, the agency operated on a lean budget that was cobbled together year after year with a combination of grants from government agencies, private foundations, and corporations and contributions from individual donors that were netted through personal connections, annual appeals, and a golf tournament. He believed he had a talented development staff; however, he was still seen as the fundraiser in chief for the organization. It was an exhausting and never-ending task. 

Bruno shared his frustration one day over lunch with his board chair, Bob Delaney, a recently retired bank executive. “I understand feeling like you’re a hamster on a never-ending wheel when it comes to keeping the place afloat,” he sympathized. “And I have the utmost respect for the work you do and how vitally important it is to people in our community. As I’ve told you many times, I think Independence Matters literally saved my son’s life when he lost his legs. You got him through his darkest hours and showed him that life was worth living. Now I have a beautiful daughter-in-law and granddaughter as a result, and I thank God every day for the part you played in making that happen. But I’ve been thinking, Bruno, we need to figure out a different way of raising money so that we’re not so reliant on philanthropy.” 

“What do you mean?” asked Bruno. “Well I’ve been doing some reading and research, and I have an idea that I think we should explore with the board,” replied Bob. “The idea is to start an arm of the agency that would retrofit the homes of people who need that type of assistance, including seniors and others who fall outside of our traditional service population. I’ve taken the liberty of talking to Norma Chavez, a lender in the bank’s community reinvestment group, about the general concept, and she told me that she’d be willing to talk to us about putting together a special loan and grant package to get something like this off the ground if we create a viable business plan. Now that I’m retired, I have the time to work on something like this—as a volunteer of course—that is, if you and the board believe this is a concept that is worth pursuing. Norma also has strong ties with the Gunderfeld Foundation (her husband is on the board), and she told me she thought they might be willing to put in a low-interest loan and grant money for an idea like this—assuming, again, that it pencils out, and that you and the board agree that we should give it a shot.” 

Bruno’s eyes lit up. “Bob, I think this is a fantastic idea! Let’s bring it up at next week’s executive committee meeting and, if they approve, move forward with a proposal to the full board to explore the feasibility of the project.” 

In the weeks that followed, the idea took off like a wild fire. The executive committee quickly and unanimously approved the idea as did the full board. A small committee was formed to develop the business plan, and a special grant was secured from the Gunderfeld Foundation to hire consultants with expertise to guide the plan’s development and, subsequently, to assist the business in its early stages if the plan proved viable. Within a year, Independence Matters Retrofitters (IMR) was born. At the end of 2 years, it was generating $2.5 million in net revenue that was funneled back into the operating budget of Independence Matters. 

Bruno and the board of Independence Matters were overjoyed with the success of the retrofit arm. IMR had a reputation for providing reasonably priced high-quality services that were specifically designed for the individual needs of each client’s home. In addition, several of its staff members were former Independence Matters clients who were grateful to have steady, meaningful work; they were especially sensitive to the needs of the people they served. 

As word of IMR’s work spread, business grew quickly. Then Bruno and Eliezer Guzman, IMR’s managing director (who was also disabled) received a special commendation from the governor, and the organization was discovered by the press. It was profiled on 60 Minutes , which led to calls from people across the country who wanted similar services, were interested in donating money or expertise, and from other nonprofits that wanted to replicate the model. IMR had to hire a director of media and community outreach whose job it was to field these inquiries, interact with the press, arrange interviews with staff and clients, and lead tours of the operations. A line of IMR products was developed that included a number of specially designed and patented hardware items for adaptive homes as well as paraphernalia such as IMR hats, mugs, and T-shirts. Revenues boomed to $18 million annually.

Independence Matters used a small portion of the IMR revenue to expand its programs, beef up its fund-raising department (which was needed to handle the surge in donations to the organization as well as increased interest from national foundations), gave senior staff generous and significant raises, and set aside more than 2 years of operating reserves. 

IMR had become so large and successful that Bruno and Eliezer decided to prepare a proposal to the board to hire a director of field operations who would fly around the country setting up nonprofit franchises of IMR. That would bring in even more revenue for the organization. It had been only 4 years since Bob had first proposed this idea to Bruno, and now it seemed like the sky was the limit on how much they could earn through this enterprise. 

When Bruno and Eliezer presented the idea to the executive committee, they were surprised at the response they received. 

These were the questions they raised:

1. What is the defining difference between a nonprofit organization and a social enterprise organization?
2. What are the legal and financial implications of a nonprofit wholly owned social enterprise? 
3. Is IMR causing Independence Matters to drift from its core mission? 
4. Are there any apparent conflicts of interest in the current setup of IMR as a program of Independence Matters? 
5. Are there operating structures that could be put in place to minimize conflicts and ensure accountability? 
6. Are there ethical implications for a social enterprise that generates much more revenue than is needed to fund the operations of the nonprofit parent? For instance, what about the time and energy needed to oversee both arms of this work?

# CASE 1.2 To start or aid an existing organization 

Miguel Tigre knew that he was one of the lucky ones. He was born in the United States to Mexican immigrant parents who instilled in him a passion for hard work, a love of family, and compassion for others. His father worked weekdays as a baker at Panaderia La Mexicana and most weekends moonlighted as a baker for a wedding caterer. Miguel’s mother had stayed home to raise the family, which, in addition to him, included his four brothers and sisters and his mother’s mother, his abuelita. His mother kept an immaculate house and was known throughout the neighborhood for her dedication to church and tamales (some joked that making perfect tamales was her second religion). 

Miguel was the oldest child. He was the first in the family to finish high school and then the first to attend college (his brother, Roberto, was now majoring in engineering at an out-of-state university; his sister, Adela, was in her first year of community college and aspired to be a nurse; and the twins, the youngest siblings, were still in middle school). The day Miguel graduated with an associate’s degree in business administration was a proud day for the Tigre family. It had taken him 4 years to finish community college because of his need to balance school and work; he had helped support the family since he was 14 years old by working in a local taco shop. He loved everything about the shop: the smells, the food, and the customers. He would often tell people that he was getting two degrees, one from the college and the other from Mr. Sanchez, who was teaching him how to run a business. Then, like a dream come true, just as he was graduating from community college, Mr. Sanchez told Miguel that he was retiring and moving to Los Angeles to live with his daughter and her family. A friend of Miguel’s family helped him secure a small business loan to buy the business. 

Miguel had now been running Miguel’s Taqueria for 2 years and had tremendous pride in his small business. He had modernized the small restaurant with fresh paint, posters, and new salsa recipes. He had a steady stream of regular customers who he knew by name (and their usual order). People loved going to Miguel’s not only for the food but also to see Miguel who it seemed never left home without a smile or a kind word for everyone he met. His parents were extremely proud of him although his mother and abuela worried that he wasn’t dating (and told him so frequently). 

Over time, several of Miguel’s customers began coming to him to ask him to translate documents they needed to sign. He was happy to help them and was always careful to be sure that they knew exactly what they were signing. Once word got out that Miguel was willing to provide this service, more and more of his customers began coming in asking for help (and he was also attracting new customers who had the same need). The neighborhood was home not only to Mexicans but also to immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and assorted South American countries as well as Africans and Middle Easterners. Miguel treated everyone equally and with respect. 

One Sunday afternoon he was watching football with Mohammed, a friend from community college whose family had emigrated from Syria. Mohammed had been in the shop recently and had witnessed a line of people waiting to have their documents translated. He said, “Bro, I think it’s cool that you’re doing that for the people, but isn’t it cutting into your bottom line? What if instead of translating everything for everyone all the time you taught people how to read English so they could be doing it themselves? You could set up a class in the shop, for like one night a week, where people could learn English. You’d lose the business for that night, but I think it would probably even out because I’m thinking that you’re losing business now when other customers come in and see a line out the door, and they know it will take them 20 minutes to a get a taco because you’re busy doing someone’s paperwork.” 

Miguel’s eyes lit up. “That makes a lot of sense … man, did you see that tackle? He just got hammered.” 

“You know what else, “said Mohammed, “You could start a nonprofit to do that stuff. I’m on the board of my nephew’s Little League and that’s what they are—a nonprofit. They get all kinds of sponsors to pay for uniforms and stuff. If you become a nonprofit, I bet you could deduct the cost of the space in the shop for the night you have the class and take donations from people. Remember that guy, Dave, who was in our communications class? His brother is an attorney. I bet he could hook you up.” 

“Let me think about it,” replied Miguel. 

During the next few days, Miguel couldn’t get Mohammed’s idea out of his mind. The more he thought about it, the more it made sense. He went online and did a little reading about nonprofit organizations. Then he called Mohammed, who called Dave to set up a meeting with his brother, the attorney. Dave’s brother said, “This is pretty straightforward. I’m happy to write up the articles of incorporation and bylaws for you for 500. Don’t worry, though. Once you get your paperwork back from the IRS and the state, you can deduct that money.” Miguel swallowed hard; $500 was serious money; he was still paying off his small business loan, and despite the influx of customers, business had been pretty flat for the past 8 months. Then he thought, “This is something that is important to do for my community. I’ll figsure out how I’m going to pay for it later.”

He had already told his sister, Adela, about the plan, and she had agreed that she and a friend, who was studying education at the community college, would be the volunteer teachers. She was proud of Miguel for taking this on and had persuaded her friend, Miriam, to help by letting her know that Miguel was not only a nice guy, he was pretty good-looking and single. Miguel went to Big Lots and bought 20 copies of My First Reading Book at $4.00 each (20 people were the maximum number the restaurant could seat). When he showed the books to Miriam she said, “Those will be fine for a start, but we really need to find a book that is more suited for adult learners. Don’t worry. I’ll ask one of my professors for a recommendation. I’m sure she’ll have some great ideas.” Miguel smiled when she said that, but he was thinking, “Cha-ching. More money out the door …” 

Adela and Miriam made a flyer to advertise the class, which would take place on Tuesday nights from 8:00 to 9:00 p.m. (his slowest night and time of the week). Miguel told them that he would have to charge a small amount in order to make up for his lost business and to help him recoup some of the money that he had laid out for the project. They all agreed that $4.00 per class seemed reasonable. He posted the flyer in his shop window, had extra copies of it on the counter, and told many of his customers about the class. 

The first evening the class was held, 18 people came. All arrived at least 5 minutes before it started. Miguel was happy to see the room filled with many of his customers and their friends. Each person was given a book, paper, and pen. Miguel had bought a large flip chart, markers, and easel to use as a blackboard. It was set up on the counter where people normally placed their orders. He gave everyone a free soda, too, because he was just that kind of guy. At the end of the evening, the students looked tired but appreciative. They all shook Miguel’s hand in thanks. Adela and Miriam were both exhausted and excited at the same time. Miriam’s professor had told her that she could earn independent study credit for working on the project. 

The following Tuesday, Miguel, Adela, and Miriam eagerly awaited the start of class. Miriam’s professor had found some classroom material that was specifically geared to adult English as a second language (ESL) learners, and Miriam was excited to try it out with the class. By 8:00, only five people had arrived. Miguel and the others were disappointed; however, Miriam and Adela did their best to teach a good class. During the days that followed, Miguel noticed that his business was slower. Many of his steady customers, the same ones who had come to the first class, weren’t coming in to place their usual orders. He couldn’t figure out what was going on. It didn’t make any sense. Finally, late Friday afternoon, Hector Morales, one of his regulars, came in to the shop. “Hector, how are you my friend?” said Miguel with a broad smile. 

“Very well, amigo,” Hector replied. The two men talked for a few minutes while Miguel prepared the order to go. Because Hector was acting like his usual self, Miguel thought it was safe to ask why he hadn’t come to class this past Tuesday. What Hector said surprised Miguel. “We enjoyed the class very much,” he said, “and appreciate all that you, your sister, and Senorita Miriam did for us. That Sunday, many of us spoke about it to the pastor. He told us about an organization called International Rescue Committee that offers English classes. They are two blocks from here but do not charge any money. So, most of us went there. I know that many customers are ashamed now to come into your shop. You tried to do something good for them, and they turned to another place for help. I told them to come and that you would not be angry, but they are worried about offending you.” 

Upon hearing this, Miguel’s jaw dropped open. It made perfect sense. Now he had to figure out a strategy for rebuilding his lost business and recouping the funds he had laid out for the nonprofit. 

Case Questions 
1. Do you think what happened to Miguel is common? What was his biggest mistake? 
2. What if there was no other literacy program in the neighborhood or surrounding community? 
3. What changes would you suggest to improve how Miguel went about forming his organization?

# Case 2.1 Dream to do it

Alberto Cortez had been on the board of Dream It Do It (DI), a midsize nonprofit serving foster youth for 3 years. DI served primarily as a fund-raising organization that provided scholarships and living assistance to college-bound foster youth. DI raised approximately $800,000 a year through a series of special events including a black tie dinner and auction and a golf tournament. During his time on the board, Alberto had served on several board committees, including the fund-raising committee. His fellow board members appreciated his insight and admired his ability to really leverage and stretch every dollar raised. Alberto credited his business acumen to his corporate experience in marketing and development for a major technology firm. It felt like a natural next step when, in September, the board nominated Alberto to assume the role of vice president of the board in the following fiscal year. He loved working with the organization and eagerly accepted the nomination. 

In December, Alberto announced to his fellow board members that he had decided to leave his corporate job and start his own company. When asked about the new company, Alberto explained it was designed to provide direct marketing support to businesses, including website design and the creation of e-commerce platforms. The board chair congratulated him. “I admire your drive, Al. If anyone can make a go of it, I’m sure you can.” 

“I’m nervous but excited at the same time,” he replied. “I already have a couple of clients lined up, and if things go well, I think I will be in a good position to help the organization financially, more so than in the past.” 

“Well, we would never turn down help from you,” chimed in the chief executive officer (CEO), Betty LeMoyne. “But I’m a little worried; are you still going to have time to chair the golf tournament this spring?” she asked. 

“Don’t worry. I think we have that thing down to a science; it practically runs itself,” Alberto assured her. Betty nodded, and they moved on to other topics. 

In late February, Alberto approached Betty. “Hey, I wanted to let you know that things are really taking off with my company,” he told her. 

“That’s great, Al.” She smiled broadly. Then thinking about it she added, “You aren’t going to have to leave us, are you?” 

“No, of course not; don’t be silly. But, I did want to talk to you about an idea I have,” he replied. He went on to explain that he thought several of the products offered by his company could be helpful to the ongoing marketing and fund-raising efforts of DI. “For example, we could help to build an entire new website that could be used to promote and manage all of the events we do. We could do some of our auctions online. Maybe even sell products made by some of the kids through the website, like a regular business.” 

“Gosh, I don’t have to tell you we have been trying to get our website functional for years.” 

“Well, I am ready to help today if needed, and I would give you a generous discount. Maybe you could count the dollar value of the services and give me credit toward my annual board pledge,” he said. 

“Why don’t you draw up a scope of work and budget, and we can present it to the board next month?” she suggested. Alberto indicated he would be happy to do so. 

Prior to the next board meeting, Betty briefed her executive committee about the idea and shared Alberto’s proposal, which indeed did reflect a generous discount. The board treasurer, Valin Brown was the first to speak. “In concept, I love this plan. It gets us where we need to go; it’s creative and cutting edge and priced well below market value …” 

“I hear an objection coming,” Betty said, filling the void. 

“You are correct. I’m not sure we can pursue this because there seems to a conflict of interest since he is a board member, and he stands to benefit from this financially. I’m pretty sure the IRS frowns on that sort of thing.” Other members of the executive committee shared similar concerns. 

“I don’t see how there is really a financial gain here since he’s giving us such a reduced rate. We priced out a new website last year, and that alone cost more than what he is proposing here,” Betty replied. 

“I know,” Valin said. “It doesn’t make sense on paper. But we have to think about perception. He is stepping into an officer role as vice president of the board in July. We have to make sure we are comfortable with how this looks to outsiders. Do we want to read about it in the paper?” 

“Maybe he should step off the board if we decide to do business with him like this,” commented a different board member. 

“Don’t say that!” Betty exclaimed. “He’s one of most active board members. I would rather skip the plan and keep him on the board. As board members, you are all are tasked with managing the bottom line, and this deal seems too good to pass up.”

“Seems iffy to me,” responded Valin. 

Case Questions 

1. Is there a conflict(s) of interest presented in this case? 
2. Describe the ethical dilemma(s) present in the case. Would it be ethical to use Alberto’s services? Why, or why not. 
3. What are the IRS policies about conflicts and self-dealing on nonprofit boards? 
4. What policies would you recommend be adopted by DI to prevent these types of situations from arising? Explain why these policies would be an improvement over current practice. 
5. Can there be a difference between an actual and perceived conflict of interest? When, if ever, is a conflict permissible?

# Case 8.1 A change in policy with unforeseen consequences

Our Daily Bread was a well-established ecumenical Christian organization dedicated to feeding the poor. What had started nearly 60 years ago through the vision and hard work of Peggy Donoghue, a former nun, had grown into a vast operation of food pantries, home-delivered meals, and senior lunch programs that operated in three New England states. A visitor to its administrative offices in Providence, Rhode Island, was greeted with a large smiling photo of Peggy (who had long since passed away) alongside the elegantly painted watchwords of the organization: “For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me,” Matthew 25:35. These same words were emblazoned on the organization’s website and on the back of each business card. 

Our Daily Bread was a darling of politicians at all levels who participated in the annual ritual of serving food to clients each Christmas and making sure a photo documented the occasion. The organization received generous financial support from city, state, and federal grants and had deep and long-standing ties to supermarket and restaurant chains. It was also popular with foundations and had a lengthy list of individual donors that provided significant funding at all levels. Our Daily Bread had a five-star rating on Charity Navigator and was known for operating with care and efficiency. Donors at all levels had deep respect for the work of the organization, which was seen as being true to its roots of service and compassion while operating with lean efficiencies. 

Several months ago, Bernie Caputo, a long-standing board member and generous donor to the organization, raised the idea of changing the organizations policies to allow for hiring people who are in same-sex marriages. “I know and respect the fact that we are a deeply Christian organization,” began Bernie, “but I also know that we are living in the 21st century and that same sex-marriage is legal. Although I never had the opportunity to personally meet Peggy, I feel in my heart that because she was so committed to social justice this is something she would have supported.” Bernie’s remarks caught Ed Flaherty, the executive director of Our Daily Bread, by surprise. He knew that Bernie’s brother was gay, but he had not had a previous discussion with him about this issue. “Bernie,” he replied calmly and professionally, “as with all major decisions we consider at this organization, my recommendation would be that we refer this matter to the personnel committee of the board. Let’s ask the group to work with Crystal (the organization’s human resources director) and come back to the board with a recommendation. 

In the intervening weeks, Crystal met several times with the personnel committee of the board. They included Jane Reinheimer, an employment lawyer; David O’Brien, the board chair who was a longtime volunteer and long-retired corporate executive; and Megan Bright, an Episcopal minister. Jane was typically straightforward. “I see my job as a board member as being someone who can provide the information we need to make an informed legal decision. The facts are that if Our Daily Bread hires anyone who is part of a legally sanctioned marriage, that we must provide employee benefits to that person and his or her family. There would clearly be some bottom-line costs involved with that; however, I do not think that that is the overarching issue for us.” Megan responded. “Christian theology is evolving on the issue of same-sex marriage and is, frankly, all over the map. My church sanctions same-sex marriage, but obviously not every church does. Although Our Daily Bread isn’t rooted in a single theology, we were founded by someone who was Catholic and saw her work as being part of a calling to Catholic social teachings. I do not know if we would be dishonoring Peggy’s memory if we were to move in this direction, although personally I think it’s the right thing for us to do.” David spoke up. “I knew Peggy, and I feel certain she would have wanted us to do this. She was all about justice.” 

After many hours of deliberation over a period of weeks, the committee decided to recommend that the organization change its policy to allow people who are in same-sex marriages to be hired. Crystal then brought the issue to the senior management committee, a group that consisted of Ed; Sal Amato, the COO; and Susie Chin, the CFO. At the meeting, Susie asked “Shouldn’t we bring Nancy into this conversation? As the director of marketing and development, she, more than anyone, has a pulse on our donor base. It seems to me that a lot of the folks who support us are conservative Catholics and conservative Christians who might not like it if we move in this direction. I know the numbers, Ed, and individual gifts make up about a quarter of our annual operating budget. We can’t afford to jeopardize that support over some social statement. We need the money to feed people—that’s our bottom line.” 

Ed responded. “I’ve worked with this board for 12 years, and I have a strong belief that our job as staff is to yield to their wisdom on these types of matters. Our board reflects our donor community, so if they as a group think we should do this, than I say we should. Let’s see how they vote at the meeting.” “I’m not sure that’s the way to go,”said Sal. “I mean, the board is dedicated to our work, but they don’t know the ins and outs of our donor community. Personally, I feel more comfortable keeping the policy as is. There’s nothing wrong with being gay; it’s just that, well, I’m not sure that we want to be an organization that openly welcomes gays who are married. I’ve worked here for 20 years, and that’s just not part of our tradition.” Ed refused to budge from his position and repeated, “Look, the board’s job is to make policy. Our job is to carry it out. We have a board committee that is making this recommendation. If the rest of the board doesn’t agree, then that’s that. But if they do agree, then we’ll implement the policy.” 

Prior to the board meeting, Sal met with Nancy Donovan, the director of marketing and development, to tell her about the proposal. “You’ve gotta talk some sense into Ed,” he said. “This is a disaster waiting to happen.” Nancy agreed and immediately went to Ed to plead her case. Ed listened patiently and then reiterated his thoughts about the role of the board. “If they do vote this in Nance, I’m going to rely on you for a good PR strategy for rolling this out to the public.” 

The following evening, the board met to discuss the proposal. The discussion was heated and lengthy. The vote to adopt the proposal was eight to three in favor. Tim O’Malley, a longtime board member immediately announced his resignation, saying with disdain that “little children are the ones that suffer when organizations like ours, under the guise of fairness and equality, adopt policies that enshrine a false definition of marriage.” He then stormed out of the room. 

As she was directed, Nancy prepared a press release and drafted a letter to send to all donors informing them of the decision. Two days later, before the donor letters were mailed, an avalanche of angry mail and telephone calls began overwhelming the organization. The actions of Our Daily Bread were hotly debated on talk radio. The bishop was quoted in the press as characterizing the decision as “supporting sin and sinful behavior.” 

Although Ed and David tried to respond by publicly stating, “This is simply a decision about whether or not someone is eligible for employment at Our Daily Bread. This is not an endorsement of same-sex marriage,” their words were drowned out by a steady drum beat of donors—large and small—who were contacting Our Daily Bread to say they would never donate another cent. Nancy and Sal pleaded with Ed and David. “We have lost 2,000 donors in 2 days!” Nancy cried. “You’ve put this organization in an impossible situation. This cause is taking up all of our energy and effort when all of our energy and effort should be going to feeding people. We can’t function with this major distraction.” 

Faced with the enormity of the enmity and financial loss, David called an emergency meeting of the board, which voted to rescind the decision. 

Case Questions:

1. Now that Our Daily Bread has rescinded the decision, what should their next course of action be to address the situation with their supporters, detractors, and the broader community? 

2. Do you think Ed was correct with his assessment about the role of the board as a policy-making body? What is the “right” balance between board and staff leadership? 

3. Do you believe the organization made the right decision to rescind the policy? Why, or why not? 

4. What, if anything, could the organization have done to prevent this backlash from the community? 

5. What is the best action to take when a nonprofit finds itself the target of a negative press campaign? 

   

### Observations

* Good for NPMBA. Not for NPS300
* Good example of how the functions in the NPMBA pyramid depend on each other vertically. In this case a change in the bottom functions of the pyramid "shaked the foundation" of all the functions on top.
* The significance of the policy was minimized, ignored, misunderstood. A Cristian organization taking a progressive position publicly is going to cause waves. It was naive decision making. 
* The essence of the mistake: the ED's insistence that this was up to the Board, and that their audience of supporters didn't need to be part of the decision.  In NPMBA terms, the Outreach function was ignored. So was the Engagement function.
* Question for participants: Where does your mind go when thinking of this case? How do you think about it?
