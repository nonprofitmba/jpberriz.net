A colleague executive director of an unprofit. Came to me, we were talking about the difficulties. She was having getting grants for the specific need for the specific program. She had.

She runs on profit. That takes care helps dog, owners. Pay for the medical care of their dogs and our profit has other programs. But getting financial assistance for that particular problem has been difficult for her. Getting grant money for. That program has been difficult for her because she finds that grand tours.

Favor funding, the adoption of pets, but not so much, the medical care of pets.

If we use the and nonprofit management framework to talk about this problem, analyze. It it would look like this. We would have to first identify what function we're talking about. Right in this issue. Oh, it would be that outreach function because the grantors are supporters. So they're going to session and the first, but it's not true.

We can start in the.

Purpose function of the framework and examine. If our business model is or question, where is this a business model issue or we try to fund a program? That really it's impossible to find or that is the wrong approach to funding to carry out this program. So make it a reality.

So, is this our business model issue? They said a comprehend issue. Do we understand the problems of the pet owners enough?

They said an issue of understanding the issue another understanding, the problem of the pet owners. So should we take the lack of interest of the grantors as feedback on the fact that this is not worth funding that we don't understand the problem? Well enough and they do, right? So that could spark a conversation with the funder with potential, funders to see if we actually have a and death understanding of this.

Then a review of our business model. Is that the question? We have actually now be trying to fund this then.

Are measuring how we measuring this the right way. How else can we measure it? They said a matter of showing data to the funders, do we have the right data? That corroborates that we understand the program problem and it is a problem that we should be trying to solve.

So that's those would be the questions to ask from the purpose function. Then we move into the outreach function which is the first one that includes grand tours and we can say. All right, first component is audience. Are we talking to the right grantors Are there more granters out there?

Do we know these people? Well enough. Do we know our grantors who they are? Are we talking to the right ones?

That is the first question for audience culture. There's a second component of outreach. Do we understand how our grinters feel? And think about decision particular, why are they making this choice?

And we can find out by engaging in conversations with them about it. With individuals in the foundations that are denying funding for this program or opting not to fund it.

Then is it a problem of messaging? So once we understand how they think about it, are we creating messages to help them help? Yeah, to make them change your mind about it. Other educating them in the issue. Source. Is our messaging correct? Powerful enough effective enough in order for them to change your mind into this.

Once we know what the care about culture and once I know if we have the right data, we connect it with the messaging the storytelling.

Then it's the channels. So are we not actually reaching the right people? In these foundations to talk to are we not reaching them at the right moment and the right way whether they're appropriate channels, Is that meetings, We set events. If a social media is a special events just for funders, right?

They said a blog where we can post articles and studies and educate them is her conference on animal welfare, though, we have to create we have to carry out. And the last thing is conversion but obviously that's conversion is carrying somebody interesting to somebody engaged. But we're not there yet because they don't want to fund us.

So that would be a way of using the framework. In order to analyze a problem to ask a deeper questions that allows us to attack a problem in from different perspectives. It doesn't solve the problem. It gives you tasks right read. Like for example, in this case, you know maybe doing a survey maybe first you know from the comprehend component is reading more getting more experts, talking to experts getting essays, I'm sorry studies articles.

What is this about or why are we trying to fund? We write and parts that there's a problem, we understand the people involved, we understand the problem. Very well, if our business model or approach of this, right? Worth funding. If their problem with their business, you know, also research and data and feedback from people that you have funded already.

So these there's tasks that come out of this. Also, in the data, what data do we have? We don't have it. Can we generate it right then? In the outreach, you know, make a list of the funders. You have you've reached out to have said, no, have any funders said yes.

Can you find any grand tours that have funded projects like this for other nonprofits? So, find out who your competition is or who offers similar programs like this one and find out who funded them then, it's culture. So talk to those foundations that have no to you, and figure out what they think, what they feel, what they believe in that's sustains their no as a priority.

You know, that sustains them for youritizing other things, why are prioritizing other things. And also if they're funders Grant are funding Prague programs like this to other nonprofits. Find out why they do it also, how they feel, what they believe, what they think about this. And then its messaging.

So how do we approach? Sorry, the act that the task would be. Well, let's figure. That's draft a message or many methods, several messages right around why this needs to be funded, right? It could say well the lifetime of an animal, it's not just about rescuing the animal, but about well keeping him safe and healthy and alive, right?

So what is your opinion on it, based on your research on experts, on your experience and your data on your measurements? And how do you match that with what the the foundations actually do care about, obviously the teacher about welfare, but I don't think the priority is maintaining their health.

They think the problem is in.
