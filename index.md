# The Nonprofit.MBA is ...  

<br>

**1. A Blog** where you can read our *research* and *thoughts* about... 

* Managing and leading nonprofits,
* Growing the capacity of nonprofits to carry out their mission, and 
* Implementing innovation practices in nonprofits.

**2. A Newsletter** where you get links to our best posts - [Subscribe](/subscribe).

**3. A Book** that will compile all this information for you to reference and share.

<br>

Our content will help you master *principles* rather than tools or techniques. Mastering a tool or techniques allows you to implement it successfully to obtain a particular output. Mastering the principles on which a tool or technique is built allows you to evaluate the tool's effectiveness, understand how it works or is supposed to work, improve it or choose a better one. Understanding principles will help you think with more clarity and make better decisions. Mastering principles will make you a better manager and leader for your nonprofit, and more successful at your career.
